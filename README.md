## Book Search React App

This app will demonstrate a simple RESTful API that collects information such as images, title, author, publish date, and direct link from Google Books APIs. The collected data will be placed to a local object and be transferred to a different component to display the information to the browser. The display info can be sort in alphabetical order or date order.
